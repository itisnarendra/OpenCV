    "##### Module\n",
    "-   Smallest unit of code organization in Python\n",
    "-   A single Python file that contains function, classes, or variables.\n",
    "    -   `math` for access to mathematical functions.\n",
    "    -   `random` for access to ramdom related functions.\n",
    "    -   `os` for interacting with the operating system.\n",
    "    -   `sys` to access system-specific parameters and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Package\n",
    "-   A package is a directory that contains multiple modules and an `__init__.py` file (which can be empty or contain initialization code).   \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Library\n",
    "-   A collection of modules that provide related functionality\n",
    "-   It is a bundle of modules designed to solve specific problesm or add features\n",
    "    -   `beautifulsoup` for HTML and XML parsing in web scraping.\n",

    "    -   `pandas` for data manipulation\n",

    "##### Framework\n",
    "-   This is a much larger structure that provides a fundation for building applications\n",
    "-   It is a complete architecture with predefined rules and patterns\n",
    "-   You build your code within the framework's structure\n",
